<div class="success-alert" #successAlert>
    <p> You should not use the ngIf directive to control the visibility of the ng-template element itself. Instead, use the ng-template element as a wrapper around the template content that you want to conditionally render. </p>
    <span (click)="cancel(successAlert)">&Cross;</span>
</div>
